"One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the
inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonmentâ€”a sense that the powers that be don't
care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti
appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short space of time, the building
becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment
becomes reality."

It's unlikely that someon can be on their game forever and never relax. But when a window is broken, that has
to be the signal that something needs to get fixed. Any excuse not to fix it is a path to abandoment and decay.
