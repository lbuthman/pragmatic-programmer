Debugging is sensitive because there is a level of perceived blame and ineptitude involved. Instead,
it should be seen as part of the problem solving process. This might be another great benefit to TDD,
the stigma of bugs is reduced because it doesn't work from the start.

- The first tip for the process of debugging is a good one: Don't Panic.
- From there, don't waste a single neuron on the thought that "this can't happen" or "is impossible".
