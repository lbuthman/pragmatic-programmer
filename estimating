In what context is the estimate being asked? Ballpark or high accuracy?

Consider the units of measurement and the relative precision. When providing more precision like 120 days, this
carries more weight than saying about 3 months, even though the actual days are the same.
  - 1 to 15 days -> days
  - 3 to 8 weeks -> weeks
  - 8 to 30 weeks -> months
  - 30+ weeks -> think hard before giving an estimate
