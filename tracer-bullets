The analogy is shooting a machine gun in the dark. You can go through a laborious set of calculations
to find and hit your target. Or, you have can use tracer bullets that give visual feedback on whether the
aim is on point. 

When developing software, especially in dealing with something new, the target is not always that well
defined and there will no doubt be changes along the way. Being able to reverse direction and not be tied
down or set in stone is a great value.

"... we're looking for something that gets us from a requirement to some aspect of the final system
quickly, visibly, and repeatable."
