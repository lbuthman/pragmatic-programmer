WISDOM
                    (W)hat do you want them to learn?
      What is their (i)nterest in what you have to say?
                How (s)ophisticated are they?
           How much (d)etail do they want?
Whom do you want to (o)wn the information?
        How can you (m)otivate them to listen to you?
        
I am intrigued by the idea of the sophistication of the audience. What does that mean and what does it
imply? It makes sense that some audience have a better background in the subject matter and will
therefore want to know more based on their background. Other audiences have interests and sophistications
that lie elsewhere. Maybe most everyone is sophisticated in some way and it is a matter of understanding
that to aid in communication. By finding their sophistication, you can appeal to the best part of them.
