"Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can't be done, is late, or is
broken, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat.
Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How's it going to sound to your boss"

I like this quote. It uncovers the implicit responsibility of the programmer (or anyone for that matter) and encourages
self awareness.
