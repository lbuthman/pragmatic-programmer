This was a surprising tip. Effort must be made to understand what the user, team, and business
need. Sometimes, putting out good software is better than great. I think it comes down to understanding
the quality requirement and bigger pircture. There are always mutliple constraints on a project and
quality is only one. So while this does not mean you can put crap or just decent code to production,
it is a guard against perfectionism that destroys schedules and leads to delays.
