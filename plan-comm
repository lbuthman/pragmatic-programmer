From what I learned about the communication process recently, the tip to plan what you want to say makes
good sense to me. If communication is process of transmission, reception, comprehension, agreement, and action,
planning what you want to communicate helps consider how well this process is executed. Moreover, it gives
time and space to consider the communication from the side that will receive the communication. It is too easy
to think that what is said will make sense to someone else since it makes sense to me. Like writing this right
now, I am winging it! It makes sense to me, but if someone else were to read it, it might actually lack a lot
of context or rely on assumptions that I contian or hold to be true.
